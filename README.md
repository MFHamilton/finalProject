üìã Project Description

This script is a ransomware simulation written in Python. It demonstrates how file encryption, decryption, and system-level manipulation can be achieved programmatically. Additionally, it includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter to simulate the interaction between the attacker and the victim.

The script performs the following actions:

Encrypts specific file types in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Saves the encryption key in a file (key.key).

Displays a GUI with a ransom message demanding payment.

Offers the victim options to pay or refuse, which can trigger further actions such as file decryption or a simulated system crash.

üîë Features

Encryption and Decryption:

Uses the cryptography library with Fernet for symmetric encryption.

Encrypts files with extensions: .txt, .pdf, .png, .jpeg, and .jpg.

Stores encrypted files in Base64 format.

Graphical User Interface:

Simulates a ransomware GUI with messages and user interactions.

Simulated Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):

Uses Windows APIs via ctypes to simulate a system crash in response to user actions.
